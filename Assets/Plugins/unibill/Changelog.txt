You will need to adapt any code that uses the old event to pay attention to the new information
available in Unibiller.onPurchaseFailed.

1.9.6

iOS & Mac App store - fixed auto renewing subscriptions not firing OnPurchaseComplete.

Note that renewal notifications are only received on Application launch.

1.9.0

All platforms (excepting Samsung Apps) - fixed potential loss of consumable purchases.

Prior to this release, there was a small window where a crash immediately following a consumable purchase could cause that purchase
to be lost; customers would be charged but Unibill's purchase event would not fire, nor would Unibill update its own database.

With this release consumable purchases are made in a two stage process to eliminate this window, ensuring that customers are never charged
for products they have not received, whilst still ensuring they are never given products they have not paid for.

Also in this release -

Unified OSX and iOS native codebase.
Removed dependency on NewtonSoft.JSON.

Removed Unicontent from Unibill for separate distribution.
