## [1.1.1] - 2016-1-7
### Fixed
- iOS & Mac App Store - Clean up global namespace avoiding symbol conflicts (e.g `Log`)
- Google Play - Activity lingering on the stack when attempting to purchase an already owned non-consumable (Application appeared frozen until back was pressed).

## [1.1.0] - 2015-12-4
### Fixed
- Mac App Store - Base64 receipt payload containing newlines.
- Hiding of internal store implementation classes not necessary for public use.

### Added
- IAppleConfiguration featuring an 'appReceipt' string property for reading the App Receipt from the device, if any;

```csharp
var builder = ConfigurationBuilder.Instance(StandardPurchasingModule.Instance());
// On iOS & Mac App Store, receipt will be a Base64 encoded App Receipt, or null
// if no receipt is present on the device.
// On other platforms, receipt will be a dummy placeholder string.
string receipt = builder.Configure<IAppleConfiguration> ().appReceipt;
```
